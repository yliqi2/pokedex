## API Usage

This application fetches data from the [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/). It retrieves a list of PokÃ©mon and their details using the following endpoints:

- **List of PokÃ©mon**: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=1302`
  - This endpoint returns a list of PokÃ©mon with basic information such as name and URL for detailed information.
  - The `limit` parameter specifies the number of PokÃ©mon to retrieve. In this case, it retrieves all available PokÃ©mon.

- **PokÃ©mon Details**: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}`
  - This endpoint returns detailed information about a specific PokÃ©mon, including its ID, types, stats, weight, height, and image URL.
  - The `{name}` parameter should be replaced with the name of the PokÃ©mon to fetch its details.

The application uses these endpoints to fetch and display PokÃ©mon data, including their images, types, and other characteristics.

## Random PokÃ©mon Details Button

The application includes a floating action button that, when pressed, selects a random PokÃ©mon from the filtered list and navigates to its detail page. This feature allows users to explore different PokÃ©mon without having to search for them manually.

## Grid View and List View

The application provides an option to switch between grid view and list view for displaying PokÃ©mon. Users can toggle between these views using the corresponding button in the app bar. The grid view displays PokÃ©mon in a grid layout, while the list view displays them in a vertical list.

## Theme Change Functionality

The application includes a theme change functionality that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes. This can be done using the theme change button in the app bar. The selected theme is applied throughout the application.

## Search Functionality and Filtering by Types

The application includes a search bar that allows users to search for PokÃ©mon by name. Additionally, users can filter PokÃ©mon by their types using the dropdown menu. This makes it easy to find specific PokÃ©mon based on their type or name.
